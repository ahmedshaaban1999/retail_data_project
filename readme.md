# Data Warehouse Modeling and Analytics
## Project Overview:
Ecommerce website dataset is ready for you to build data warehouse for to answer business questions. The project consist of 3 main phases.
1. Building data warehouse model to serve business queries.
2. Building ETL pipeline to land data into the warehouse.
3. Run analytical queries to answer business questions

## Resources:
Dataset is used from [this](https://medium.com/@williamong1400/project-1-solving-problem-in-e-commerce-with-data-ac7ed38d7b4) series. I just played around with it using pandas, numpy and [sdv](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV) to transform the limited files into an endless stream of data. I then created a mysql database to serve as a destination for the generated data - to act as an operational data store if you can say so -.

## Requirements:
-	Design Data warehouse schema.
-	Build ETL pipeline to load data into DW
-	Answer Below business questions:
    1.  When is the peak season of our ecommerce ?
    2.	What time users are most likely make an order or using the ecommerce app?
    3.	What is the preferred way to pay in the ecommerce?

    10.	How long are the difference between estimated delivery time and actual delivery time in each state?

## Key Deliverables:
-	DW schema
-	ELT Code
-	Business question answers with queries
